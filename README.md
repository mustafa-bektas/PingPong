A modern take on the classic arcade game, built in Unity. This project is a complete and playable game that includes AI, scoring, and a dynamic camera system.

## Gameplay Features

-   **Classic Ping Pong Gameplay**: The core mechanics involve two paddles and a ball. The objective is to score by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.
-   **Player and AI Controls**: The player controls their paddle with the arrow keys, while the opponent paddle is controlled by a simple AI that tracks the ball's position.
-   **Scoring System**: The game keeps track of the score for both the player and the opponent, displaying it on the screen.
-   **Dynamic Ball Speed**: The ball's speed increases each time it is hit by a paddle, making the game progressively more challenging.
-   **Power-Up System**: A system is in place for spawning power-ups that can be collected by the ball. (Note: Specific power-up effects are not yet implemented).
-   **Dynamic Camera**: The camera shakes and reacts to game events, such as scoring, to create a more engaging experience.
-   **Visual Effects**: The game uses custom shaders for the ball and particle effects to create a distinct visual style.
